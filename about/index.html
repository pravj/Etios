<p>
  Oh Hello!
</p>

<p>
  As the navigation bar says, my name is Pravendra Singh. I have a keen interest in solving real life problems with <i>For loops</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Currently I'm a senior Computer Science student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
</p>

<p>
  Although I don't follow a discriminative path but if you want me to categorize it, I'm interested in <i>Data Science</i>, <i>Information Retrieval</i>, <i>Programming Languages</i>, <i>Distributed Systems</i> and everything else in the universe including <i>Pan Pizzas</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever I'm not hitting my system's keypad, I can be found doing anything. For example, travelling through the vast repository of repositories in <a target="_blank" title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/pravj">GitHub</a> or <a target="_blank" title="Instagram" href="https://instagram.com/pravj">clicking random stuffs</a> around me, if my phone's battery permits or collecting tones <a target="_blank" title="SoundCloud" href="https://soundcloud.com/pravj/likes">here</a> and <a target="_blank" title="YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5hSueDZEA0FsDlDeAtBLYAHyr4-dlr9u">there</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Other than <i>Computer Science</i> and random human stuffs, I'm passionate about <i>Space Science</i> and <i>Aeronautics</i>. I don't miss a single opportunity to get a glance of <i>Internation Space Station</i>. You too can subscribe at <a target="_blank" title="NASA" href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">Spot The Station</a>, if you want to see <i>ISS</i> hovering above your air space.
</p>

<p>
  And yeah, I forgot to tell you, I can attempt poems also, usually I write them when I'm drunk with water. You can head to my Quora blog <a target="_blank" title="Quora" href="http://randomlygeneratedthoughts.quora.com/">Random Thought Generator</a>, if you want to read them.
</p>

<p>
  <b>What, this is not enough?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Yeah, it isn't. In my free time I do sketching, painting and silly arts & crafts stuff.

  I love the song <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b_YVrex0yI' target='_blank' title='Sweet Disposition'>Sweet Disposition</a> so much that I ended up painting this on my wall.

    Once you have all that, you just need to mix them up and fry in a pan for 20 minutes. That's it.

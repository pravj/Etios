    <i>teamwork</i> was the first Data related big thing of mine, I had this pinch to work on something in the GitHub Data Challenge, and the dream got completed with the <i>teamwork</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked on it with one of my friend <a target="_blank" title="Nairitya Khilari" href="http://www.nairityak.in/">Nairitya Khilari</a>, although it wasn't the logic behing its nomenclature.

  <p>
    <i>teamwork</i> was a dashboard for organizations on GitHub, where you can see analytics that you don't get to see in general. It had a aggregated <i>GitHub Contribution Calendar</i>, per user contribution to the organization, member and repository based leaderboards and similar features.

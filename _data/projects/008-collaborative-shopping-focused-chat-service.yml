    This summer I worked with <a target="_blank" title="Myntra" href="http://www.myntra.com">Myntra</a> as a Software Development Intern. Yes, the same service that went <i>mobile app</i> only.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before this, I have never used a smartphone, so I wasn't very well aware about the mobile boom, hence Java and Android Development weren't my mates.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked with the <i>Mobile Engineering</i> team there, and worked on a <i>Collaborative shopping focused chat service</i>. It allows you to form chat groups and share <i>Myntra products</i> as well as text and image messages, with the group participants.

  <p>
    Powered with push notification for mentions, typing indicators, rich message content and whatever we see in a general chat application, it was a real fun and learning experience.

    All this started when I was figuring out a way to <i>reverse map</i> default user avatars on GitHub. Those avatars are images, that looks like a 5x5 matrix, symmetric along the vertical axis. For example, check this out for my username, <a href="https://github.com/identicons/pravj.png">pravj</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later I realised that I can devise a better implementation, that improves the <i>collision resistance</i> of the generated images.

    For the new version, I ended up using the color palette that we see in the GitHub's contribution calendar. It uses some nice mathematical arrangements to improve the results.

    It was cold January of 2015, people were tweeting about the first ever Gopher Gala. And there is no second thought on my love for the language. So I managed to form a team with two of my friends and started looking for an idea.

    As I had no experience in developing a web application with Go, before the event, I worked on a sample application to learn the Beego framework. You can have a look at the application here, <a target="_blank" title="beehub" href="https://github.com/Gomob/beehub">beehub</a>, it was a GitHub Oauth application in Beego.

    Hackman was supposed to have features that would solve all the problems, right from the creating a hackathon, publising it and finilising the results. During the event, I talked with one of the Gopher Gala organizer and he loved the idea, he even asked us to add some additional features.

    Although we weren't able to complete the entire thing in the small time period the hackathon, later we also dreamed of having Hackman as a Y Combinator company.

    Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups, abbreviated OSPI, is one of my favorite project. I worked on it during one of my winter vacations when I was getting bored at home. You better read the article for it, <a href="#">Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups</a>.

    I started working on it after reading an interview of the Flipkart CTO, Amod Malviya. In this report you can see the evolution of the Open Source community in the Indian startup ecosystem.

    It has some nice visualizations marking their opinion, so nice that now I have no idea, how did I come up with them.

    OSPI earned some massive attention on the Holy Internet, and I got to interact with some inspiring people because of this.

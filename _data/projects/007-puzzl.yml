  <p>
    Puzzl is an advance version of the classical sliding puzzle game, built with Go, to be played in terminals. If you want to read, I have also written an article about its development, <a href="#">Development story of the puzzl</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I got the wave to work on it, my main motive was to play with the Goroutines and Channels in Go. Later I got a secret inspiration to work on it, and I ended up completing it in a format, which was good looking, at least to me.

  <p>
    I have also written a paper on it, which is on the arXiv by Cornell University.

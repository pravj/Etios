    geopattern was my first ever Go project, I worked on it because I was asked to learn Go by the <a target="_blank" title="Datadog" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> CEO, Olivier Pomel. And you know, vacations are the best time to learn something new, so I stayed in the institute during my Diwali vacations and completed it.

    Like all other projects of mine, I have an article for the geopattern development also. You can read it here, <a href="http://pravj.github.io/blog/going-on-the-go-path/">geo_pattern &#58; going on the Go path</a>.

    I was lucky enough to see it ranking &#35;2 on <a target="_blank" title="Hacker News" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8520961">Hacker News</a>. A <i>dream-come-true</i> moment, it was.

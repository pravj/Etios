    Working on the <i>Doga</i> was the one of the best things to me, I still remember that week.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Doga</i> was the assignment given to me for an intern position at <a target="_blank" title="Datadog" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>. Without continuing the mistery, I got the internship offer after it. Although I got unlucky later, and unable to get through the visa process, so had to leave the internship.

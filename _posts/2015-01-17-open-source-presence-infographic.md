Almost a month ago, I asked a question on HackerNews. [How do you start a product/interface design process?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9833994) It didn't get much activity though, may be because it was weekend time.

 I love the confusion there in the question. A good man replied to the it and pointed towards the part creating confusion. And then I corrected him saying, "Ohh sorry, what I actually meant was this."

 I have been through a lot of resources since asking that question and now I have a little idea that why I wasn't sure then.

 > It was a new area that I have never properly looked upon. Which is full of spirit and ideas.

 I'm talking about the *design* world. I'm still terrible in this, I end up copying(not exactly) things
